This repository contains a notebook with part of the analysis made in our [ACM Web Science'19](https://websci19.webscience.org/) poster. Particularly:

1. It describes the data released with the poster:
2. It shows how to fit the models of stance and demographic factors.

It also contains part of the data set, including user IDs from Twitter and their respective inferred attributes. We release this in spirit of replication of our results.
